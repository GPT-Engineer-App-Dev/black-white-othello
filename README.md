# black-white-othello

Please implement a basic Othello game with the following features:

- An 8x8 game board, using green and buff colors for the squares 
- Ability for players to place black and white circular pieces on the board by clicking
- The game should enforce the rules of Othello:
  - Black always moves first
  - Pieces must be placed so they capture one or more of the opponent's pieces between the newly placed piece and another of the current player's pieces
  - Captured pieces change color
- The game should detect when a player has no valid moves on their turn and end the game
- Show a message indicating which player won
